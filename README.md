The purprose of this project was to teach me a few things about pathing and game design itself. 
Unlike most tower defense games, this one has no predetermined paths for the enemies. On the contrary, the path is created by 
placing turrets along the way. If an enemy is blocked by a turret, a new path is calculated. 

I'd love to add some actual assets for the game instead of using PNG's and assigning a hitbox... ![path](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39606152/191058325-912ea924-3ff3-41f6-bd22-83329ebbad6c.png)
